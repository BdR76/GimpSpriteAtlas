GIMP SpriteAtlas
================

GIMP SpriteAtlas is a plug-in to compile
sprite textures for use in games and websites.

The plug-in takes several smaller images and compiles them into a single image.
It uses a packing algorithm to use as little space as possible in the final
texture. And it exports a JSON, Atlas, XML or CSS file with the sprite names and
their coordinates within the compiled texture.

How to install
-------------
First install [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), then place the Python script file
[create_spriteatlas.py](/GIMP%202/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins) in the GIMP folder,
typically under program files:

	Windows (all users)
	%PROGRAMFILES%\GIMP 2\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins\
	Windows (single user)
	%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins\
	
	Linux
	~/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins/

After you've copied the file in this directory, open GIMP and the plug-in is
available in the menu:

	Filters -> Animation -> Sprite Atlas

How to use it
-------------

1. Open GIMP
2. Open your images as layers (Ctrl + Alt + O)
3. Start the plug-in from `Filters > Animation > Sprite Atlas`
4. Select an export folder
5. Press OK to generate the sprite texture

So first open all your images as layers. You can do this from the menu
`Open As Layers` (Ctrl + Alt + O), select all your files and click `Open`.
Alternatively, you can first open one image (preferably the largest one), and
then drag and drop all the remaining images onto the layers window.

Note: opening images as layers can be remarkably slow
(see [issue report](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/8200)).

Then go to the menu `Filters > Animation > Sprite Atlas` to open the GIMP
SpriteAtlas plug-in, you'll see the following dialog.

Make sure to select an export folder, this is where the output image and
coordinates datafile will be exported to. The default export folder is
`\tmp\`, if you don't change this to an actual existing folder you will get
the following error message:

	RuntimeError: Could not open '\tmp\sprites.png' for writing: No such file or directory

Press OK to generate the spriteatlas and export the sprite texture and sprite
metadata file.

Options
-------

**Export filename**: Export filename for both the texture image and the
coordinates file, for example, set it to `sprites123` and the output files
will be named `sprites123.png` and `sprites123.json`.

**Export folder**: Output folder for both the texture image and the
coordinates file.

**Export filetype**

* JSON TexturePacker-array, compatible with the TexturePacker format
* JSON TexturePacker hash, compatible with the TexturePacker format
* libGDX TextureAtlas, .atlas text file
* CSS sprites, can be used for html and websites
* XML, plain xml format

The TexturePacker-array/hash output is the preferred format for use with
[Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/). If you need any other format, you can edit
the Python code and add a custom function or you can post an
[issue here](https://github.com/BdR76/GIMPSpriteAtlas/issues).

**Pad one pixel between sprites** separate all sprites by at least one pixel,
recommended to avoid *texture bleeding*. If a sprite texture contains sprites
that are right next to each other, in some graphics engines the
texture tiles can "overflow" and pick up parts of neighboring tiles.

**Extending sprites** the plug-in can automatically extend the edges on some
sprites Up Down Left and/or Right. This can be useful to make tiles in a
tilemap align seemlessly, so without any lines between tiles. For example if
you want to extend a sprite **D**own and **R**right you can add `[ext=DR]` to
the name like this

	mytile01 [ext=dr].png

In the compiled texture, the plug-in will extend this sprite by one pixel down
and one pixel right, meaning it will copy the bottom row pixels and the
right-most column of pixels of that sprite.

Sprite Sheet
------------
This repository also includes a `create_spritesheet.py` plugin, for the sake
of completeness. It creates a sprite sheet where all the sprites are the same
size in a simple grid layout. This doesn't require a coordinates file.
The tile size will be the width and height of the original image.

It is based on a [plug-in by Spydarlee](https://github.com/Spydarlee/scripts/tree/master/GIMP)
but with some bugfixes and additional options

Trouble shooting / Known issues
-------------------------------
* Opening images as layers is remarkably slow in GIMP (see 
[issue report](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/8200)).
Once you've created a sprite texture, it's best to also save the original
image with the layers as a `.xcf`. If you want to make changes to the texture
at a later time (add/remove sprites) then you can more quickly open the `.xcf`
instead of having to re-add all the images as layers again.

* You can use this plug-in create any custom coordinates format or custom
preprocessing by editing the Python file. Alternatively you can also create
sprite atlas/textures using the 
[TexturePacker Online (free)](https://www.codeandweb.com/tp-online)
or [Leshy SpriteSheet Tool](https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/)
